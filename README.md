# saulscript
Basically, I'm writing this crummy language because I need something that doesn't need to run well but will integrate
into a dumb game I'm making that uses user-generated scripts. Intention is to support basic operations and calls to
bound functions, and then operation counts and resource/time limits to scripts.

To-do:
- [x] Lexer
- [x] AST generation
- [x] AST Execution
- [x] Math operators
- [x] Assignemnt Operators
- [x] Data structures
- [x] The other random things I completed before I made this list
- [ ] Print statements (most people probably do this first but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)
- [x] Function invocations (doing this first because the logic for context-binding needs to be done)
- [x] Function declaration
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Operation counting
- [ ] Resource limits
- [ ] Time limits
- [ ] Move to Cython?

I named this thing after my pet rabbit
