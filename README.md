# saulscript
Basically, I'm writing this crummy language because I need something that doesn't need to run well but will integrate
into a dumb game I'm making that uses user-generated scripts. Intention is to support basic operations and calls to
bound functions, and then operation counts and resource/time limits to scripts.

I named this thing after my pet rabbit
